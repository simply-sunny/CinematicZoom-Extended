Smooth, configurable zoom with animated cinema bars.

Hold a key and the view eases in while black bars slide across the screen, then eases back out when you let go. Cinematic Zoom Extended adds two independent profiles, six easing curves, ultra-wide zoom, snap targets and fine control over what the HUD hides.

A fork of [Cinematic Zoom (Fabric)](https://modrinth.com/mod/cinematic-zoom-fabric) by [Mel1x](https://github.com/mel1x), based on the original [Cinematic Zoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cinematic-zoom) by [KubePixel](https://www.curseforge.com/members/kubepixel/projects). Published with permission. Not affiliated with or endorsed by either author.

## Features

- **Two profiles.** Cinematic (with bars) and Regular (without), each with its own key, zoom, timing, curves, toggle mode, snap targets and HUD options.
- **Smooth motion.** Per-frame easing with six curves and separate in and out durations.
- **Framing.** Adjust the bars live with the arrow keys, zoom out to 0.5x with ultra-wide, step the wheel in fixed increments, and snap to targets like `2x` or `45fov`.
- **Camera and HUD.** Scale mouse sensitivity, remove view bobbing, and hide the HUD, crosshair and hands independently. F3 hides with the HUD.
- **Settings screen.** Cloth Config through Mod Menu, in English and Russian.
- **Easy switching.** Cinematic Zoom 1.3 configs migrate automatically, and Zoomify, Ok Zoomer, Just Zoom and similar mods are imported on first launch.

## Installation

1. Install Fabric Loader, Fabric API, Cloth Config and Mod Menu for your Minecraft version.
2. Put the jar for your Minecraft version in `mods`.
3. Remove any other Cinematic Zoom build; only one can be installed.

## Usage

| Action | Default key |
| --- | --- |
| Cinematic zoom | `C` |
| Zoom without bars | Unbound, set in Controls |
| Increase bar size | `↑` |
| Decrease bar size | `↓` |

Hold the zoom key to zoom and release to return, or turn on **Toggle zoom**. Scroll the mouse wheel while zooming to change magnification. Settings are under **Mod Menu → Cinematic Zoom Extended**.

## Compatibility

- **Minecraft:** 1.20.1 to 26.3 on Fabric. Java 17 for 1.20.1, 21 for 1.21.x, 25 for 26.x.
- **Client-side only.** Servers do not need it.
- **Other zoom mods** conflict with FOV handling. Import their settings instead of running both.
- **Sodium, Iris and shaders:** no known conflicts, not specifically tested in 1.0.0.
- **OptiFine** is unsupported and **Quilt** is untested.

Full configuration, import and troubleshooting notes are on [GitHub](https://github.com/simply-sunny/CinematicZoom-Extended#readme).
